1-Week SMART Goals (Week 1)
Build agent to simulate dry run stubs pre-mainnet deployment for performance optimization across all planned defi strategies.

Finalize initial design assets (logo v1, banner, character set concept, and 8 frontend icons) and deliver a Figma file plus SVG/PNG exports to the designer.

Build system for early-access email signup + referral system on trovefi.xyz

Create materials v0: a 12-slide pitch deck draft, a docs outline in /docs, and a 3–5 page whitepaper skeleton.

Update: Had call with flow dev team -> Will avoid testnet as it will be verry time consuming to contact all of the existing defi protocols -> will shift focus straight to a final mainnet deployment while mocking

Schedule follow up calls on product with Flow team and also one of the bootcamp mentors.
