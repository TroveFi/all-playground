# In your Solidity contracts (vault + strategies)

Vault standard & routing

ERC-4626 vault (deposits in FLOW, USDC, WETH on Flow EVM).

Strategy interface(s) for: DEX swaps, lending/borrowing, staking wrapper, and optional bridge adapters.

Swap execution

KittyPunch (PunchSwap V2) router for simple swaps and liquidity ops.

Trado / iZiSwap V3 (factory + liquidityManager + swap/quoter) for concentrated-liquidity routes.

Lending/Borrowing

More.Markets (Aave-style) via PoolAddressesProvider → Pool (deposit, withdraw, borrow, repay) and (optionally) PoolConfigurator for admin ops.

Staking (Ankr)

Treat ankrFLOWEVM as your staked FLOW representation; strategy swaps FLOW↔ankrFLOWEVM on DEX rather than calling Cadence staking directly on EVM.

Bridging hooks (optional on-chain)

Stargate V2 TokenMessaging and OFTs (ETH/USDC/USDT) for cross-chain moves to Ethereum/L2s.


Price/risk

Pyth/Stork proxy readers for spot price sanity checks, slippage limits, and oracle-guarded deposits.

VRF

Call Cadence Arch precompile from Solidity for gas-cheap randomness (e.g., randomized rebalancing windows), or commit-reveal if user-facing.

Attestations (optional)

EAS (SchemaRegistry/EAS) to attest vault snapshots or rebalancing decisions for transparency.

# In your Python agent (off-chain brain)

Route selection & rebalancing

Pull pool states (More.Markets utilization, APYs), DEX quotes (KittyPunch, Trado/iZiSwap), and oracle prices (Pyth/Stork).

Compute target weights across: Ankr (via ankrFLOWEVM), DEX LPs, More.Markets, and (optionally) bridged venues.

Transaction orchestration

Approvals + swaps on KittyPunch/Trado; deposits/borrows on More.Markets; vault harvest()/rebalance() calls.

Optional bridging: call Stargate contracts (or just use Stargate/Relay APIs and send one chain tx).

Risk & ops

Slippage bounds, oracle sanity checks, LTV/health-factor thresholds, circuit-breakers, liquidity checks.

Bridge liveness checks (Stargate endpoints), fallback routes (Relay aggregator API).

Observability

Persist position inventory, realized yields, fee accounting; emit EAS attestations if enabled.
