Start with agent balancing between:

Ankr Staking - Validator

KittyPunch - Dex

Trado.one - Dex

More.Markets - Lending/Borrowing

Sturdy.Finance - Lending/Borrowing

Izumi.finance - Lending/Borrowing

VRF driven strategy?? - what this even looks like? but test



Then Add in ways for agent to interact with:
 - Bridging via Bridge.flow.com to Ethereum -> Then allowing for MEV (cant do on flow cus of architecture)
 Other bridges (relay.link, stargate, debridge)

   - NFT-DeFi hybrid strategies leveraging Flow's NFT ecosystem?


Add possible arbitrage oppourtunities across the board for the agent before trying to do anything with own strategy.
