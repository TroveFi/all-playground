Primary Profitability Metrics
1. Net APY Calculation

stFLOW staking APY: ~9-10% currently
FLOW borrowing rate: Check the lending pool's current borrow APY
Net spread: Staking APY - Borrowing APY
Break-even point: When borrowing costs exceed staking rewards

2. Leverage Multiplier Effect

1x leverage: Net APY × 1.7
2x leverage: Net APY × 2.19
3x leverage: Net APY × 2.83

Risk Params:

Current LTV ratio: Your debt / collateral value
Maximum LTV: Usually ~75-80% before liquidation
Safety buffer: Distance from liquidation threshold
Collateral factor: How much you can borrow against stFLOW (typically 60-70%)

stFLOW/FLOW exchange rate: Currently ~0.77 
Rate volatility: Historical fluctuations in this ratio
Liquidation price: The stFLOW/FLOW ratio that triggers liquidation


Red Flags:
Borrowing APY > Staking APY
Pool utilization above 90%
Recent high volatility in stFLOW/FLOW ratio
Your position would be >60% of your total portfolio
You can't monitor the position regularly
