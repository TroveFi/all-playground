# Strategic Questions for Flow DeFi Engineer Call

Main Q's:
My architecture is using a lot of existing strategies and protocols and optimising across them, (More.Markets, IncrementFi, Ankr, etc.) so one important thing is to be able to mock these systems with accurate gas calculations, etc to be able to test performance metrics and optimization without deploying and testing with funds on mainnet. Ideal case that accurately captures MEV, slippage, and gas dynamics?


## üéØ Core Strategy Development Philosophy

### Novel Strategies vs. Existing Integration
1. **"From your perspective building DeFi infrastructure on Flow, what's the strategic value difference between:**
   - **Building novel yield mechanisms** (like custom AMMs, lending algorithms, derivatives)
   - **vs. Creating intelligent agents that optimize across existing protocols** (More.Markets, IncrementFi, Ankr, etc.)
   
   **Follow-up:** At what TVL/complexity threshold does building proprietary strategies become more valuable than optimization layers?"

2. **"For an ML-driven diversification system, what are the key advantages you've seen when protocols control their own yield generation vs. routing through existing strategies?**
   - Risk management capabilities?
   - Data/signal quality?
   - Competitive moats?
   - Revenue capture?"

3. **Are there specific gaps in Flow's DeFi ecosystem where novel strategies would be most impactful?"**

### High-Frequency Strategy Mocking
4. **"For strategies involving high-frequency rebalancing or complex trading sequences, are there any quick reccomendations or advice for:**
   - **Mainnet forking/simulation** that accurately captures MEV, slippage, and gas dynamics?
   - **Testing strategies that require multiple blocks/time periods** to show effectiveness?
   - **Modeling realistic market conditions** vs. sterile test environments?"

   - Gas cost variations
   - Liquidity depth changes
   - Cross-protocol state synchronization"

ANY STRATEGIES THAT MIGHT NOT BE DEPICTED ON MAINNET
