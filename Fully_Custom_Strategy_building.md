Key Design Decisions & Patterns
1. Risk Management Through Diversification
Instead of putting all funds in one protocol, you spread across:

Lending protocols (More.Markets, Sturdy Finance)
DEX farming (IncrementFi, multi-DEX arbitrage)
Cross-chain opportunities (Celer bridge)
Staking (Ankr liquid staking, validators)
Advanced strategies (Delta neutral, AI-powered)

2. Automated Rebalancing Logic

function _shouldRebalance() internal view returns (bool) {
    // Check if any strategy has drifted beyond threshold
    uint256 deviation = currentAllocation > targetAllocation 
        ? currentAllocation - targetAllocation 
        : targetAllocation - currentAllocation;
    
    return deviation >= vaultConfig.rebalanceThreshold;
}
The vault automatically rebalances when allocations drift too far from targets.


3. Yield Harvesting Strategy
Each strategy has a harvest() function that:

Claims rewards from underlying protocols
Converts rewards back to the base asset
Either compounds or returns yield to the vault

4. Emergency Exit Mechanisms
Every strategy implements emergency exits for:

Smart contract risks
Market crashes
Protocol exploits
Regulatory issues



# For fully customized, e.g.:
Instead of calling Ankr's staking contract, you'd build your own staking mechanism. 
Instead of using More.Markets lending, you'd create your own lending algorithm.

# Why This Matters: Competitive Moats


When you integrate with existing protocols, you're essentially building on commoditized infrastructure. Anyone can call the same functions and get the same yields. Your only edge is in:

Allocation optimization
Gas efficiency
User experience
Marketing

But when you build your own logic, you create:

Proprietary yield sources that others can't access
Unique risk/return profiles that differentiate your product
Network effects that get stronger with usage
First-mover advantages in new yield categories


# The Most Promising Novel Concepts
Based on technical feasibility and potential impact:
ðŸ¥‡ Dynamic Fee AMM (Start Here)

Why it works: Simple math, clear value proposition
Moat: Better capital efficiency attracts more liquidity
Revenue: 2-5% fee premium over static models

ðŸ¥ˆ Reputation-Based Lending

Why it works: Creates loyalty and reduces risk
Moat: Network effects - more users = better risk assessment
Revenue: 10-20% better loan terms drive volume

ðŸ¥‰ Evolutionary Strategy Breeding

Why it works: Continuously improving without human intervention
Moat: Compound learning advantage over time
Revenue: 20-40% performance improvement
