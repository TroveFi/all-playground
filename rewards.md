# Rewards:
First:
Every X, someone earns the yield
Every X, N people earn big yield
Customizable risk:
Users can individually configure their risk/reward when depositing -> and further enhanced by how long they choose for their delta T's

[enable rewards every delta T (i.e. every X number of epochs) or upon withdrawal??]

Higher risk + larger delta T -> better reward



Yield Reward Format:
Stakers are airdropped keys [color coded in accordance with how long they staked and their chosen risk level and shiny one for all-in-ers], keys can be opened for rewards to see if they are winners. 

Special collabs with NFT projects???

Add some atrificially inflated reward for bigger/longer stakers to encourage this.
